# About Me

Hello and welcome to my personal site. This website is currently a work in progress decentralized blog, built on-top of IPFS. To achieve this for the initial prototype I am using a lightweight, static 
site, but in future intend to experiment with NoDB solutions.

This project can be watched at github.com/bhayward93/ipfs-blog , you are also welcome to add features, or fork. The initial plan is to develop a blog, then see how I can best optimize for speed. Nothing 
particularly interesting in the repository currently, but I intend to create a kind of boilerplate for other people wanting to host their sites on IPFS (along with a tutorial) , or even possibly down the 
line, turn it into an IPFS blog generator.

A bit about me and my background; I have a passion for Blockchain and Web technologies, and work actively on various large scale projects spanning from banks to ICOs. I am a firm believer in the future of 
cryptocurrencies and am a supporter of the FOSS movement.

## Getting Started

Neo-HPSTR takes advantage of Sass and data files to make customizing easier. These features require Jekyll 2.x and will not work with older versions of Jekyll.
